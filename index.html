<!-- 2. Scenario: Product with Discount
You are creating an e-commerce platform, and each product has a name, price, and category.
 You need to be able to apply a discount to the product and retrieve its final price after applying the discount.
•             Question:
 How would you define a Product class with properties name, price, and category?
–            What methods would you include to:
•             Apply a discount to the product (e.g., applyDiscount(amount) method)?
•             Retrieve the price after discount (e.g., getPriceAfterDiscount() method)? -->
